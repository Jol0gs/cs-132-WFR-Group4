# Poverty Analysis in the Philippines

## Background  
Poverty is one of the oldest and most pressing societal problems, and it is clearly evident in the Philippine context. This is why poverty reduction is one of the central foundations of the **United Nations' SDG 1 (No Poverty)**.  

It has always been one of the Philippines' persistent issues and is often linked to **income inequality, inflation, regional disparities, and employment challenges**.  

To address this, national and international institutions like the **PSA, ADB, and World Bank** regularly track data related to poverty. Given these data, we can integrate them to enable deeper analysis of factors and trends.

## Problem / Questions  
1. **Trend Analysis** – How has the poverty headcount ratio in the Philippines evolved throughout the years?  
2. **Determinants of Poverty** – What demographic or economic factors (e.g., GDP per capita, employment rate) correlate with changes in poverty levels?  
3. **Forecasting** – Can we predict the poverty headcount for **2025** based on recent trends of these factors?

## Proposed Solutions / Methodology  
1. Use **time-series analysis** to track changes in poverty headcount ratio over multiple years.  
2. Apply **correlation and regression analysis** (e.g., linear regression, multiple regression) to test relationships between poverty and candidate predictors (GDP per capita, employment, household income).  
3. Develop a **predictive model** (time-series forecasting or machine learning regression) to project poverty rates for 2025.

## Hypothesis  
- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** No significant correlation exists between GDP per capita (or employment rate) and poverty headcount.  
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** There is a significant correlation between GDP per capita (or employment rate) and poverty headcount.
